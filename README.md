## From Zero to Hero

There are many resources out there teaching you about MCP.
What I have found is it usually an overview, thus too simple.

Anyhow, they are great when you start to learn this new thing.

Hence,  I recommend you this series of youtue videos for you to watch.

1. MCP In 26 Minutes (Model Context Protocol): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOhLoixrJXo
2. you need to learn MCP RIGHT NOW!! (Model Context Protocol): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuTcle5edjk

They talk about MCP from overview/general use to developing (sort of vibe coding level).

Now, when it comes to an actual developing a MCP server, you will need to do the document reading yourself.
The only good place to do that is here: https://modelcontextprotocol.io
